 JGR - Java GUI for R - start script for unix systems
------------------------------------------------------

This package contains code that is necessary to run JGR.

 How to compile
----------------

As of JGR 1.4 everything is 'autoconf'igured.

0) If you want to use R 2.3.0, you need to compile a
   patched version of R. Get the sources for R 2.3.0
   and apply the supplied R-2.3.0.patch - e.g.:
   cd R-2.3.0
   patch -p0 < ~/JGRlinux/R-2.3.0.patch
   Compile and install such patched R.

   Background: R 2.3.0 installs special signal handlers
   that (by definition) don't work in multi-threaded
   environments such as Java. Unfortunately there is no
   way to disable this "feature" in R 2.3.0. The patch
   allows us to disable it by setting NO_SIG env var.

1) Make sure JDK 1.4 or higher is installed (on Linux
   1.5 or later must be installed) and all java
   commands are ont the PATH. Alternatively you can
   set JAVA_HOME instead.
2) ./configure
3) make

 How to start JGR
