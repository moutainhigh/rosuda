 JGR - Java GUI for R - start script for unix systems
------------------------------------------------------

This package contains a script that starts JGR.
In contrary to previous versions, for JGR 1.4
all code is now in R packages such that only a single
shell script is needed.

 How to compile
----------------

As of JGR 1.4 everything is 'autoconf'igured.

1) Make sure you have
   - R 2.3.0 patched 2006-05-08 or later
     (2.3.0 release version will NOT work!)
   - JDK 1.5 (aka J2SE 1.5) with java command
     on the PATH. Alternatively you can set
     JAVA_HOME to point to the JDK root directory.

2) ./configure
   # this step will create the run script

3) make
   # this step will install necessay R packages
   # (if you are in the sudoers file and sudo is installed)
   # you can do this manually is necessary, install:
